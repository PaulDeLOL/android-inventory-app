Amphibians App - Pablo Guardia

================================

Amphibians App created for Assignment 5 of COP4656 - Mobile Programming.
The app's source code follows the codelab for the Amphibians app in Unit 5 of the Android Basics with Compose course. The code contains a URL redirecting to the host of a JSON file, which in turn contains the information needed, including the name of the amphibian, a cartoon picture of it, and its description. All three elements must be displayed on the phone screen as a scrollable list. The elements are not clickable.
